# Chen Wenjun's Personal Homepage 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a developer passionate about technological innovation, focusing on backend development, large model applications, and various cutting-edge technologies. My tech interests include C/C++; Java & Spring Boot; Redis; Python, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and multi-agent systems. I'm currently exploring multi-agent paradigms and optimizations such as Plan & Solve, ReAct, and Reflexion. I have a solid computer science foundation and strong teamwork skills, and I keep a persistent curiosity for new technologies 🚀.

## 💻 Projects

### 1. [Neighborhood Group · Community Group-Buying Platform](https://github.com/chenwenjun/project-neighborhood) 🏘️

- **Tech stack**: Spring Boot, MyBatis, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ  
- **Description**: Designed and implemented a group-buying social e-commerce system covering the full flow from price calculation and order locking to payment settlement and refunds.  
- **Key responsibilities**:
  - Designed and implemented a promotion rule filtering engine using the Chain of Responsibility pattern.
  - Implemented discount/price trial calculation and improved response performance via multithreaded asynchronous loading.
  - Used Redis bitmaps for precise user filtering and solved high-concurrency performance bottlenecks.

### 2. [Intelligent Business Assistant (Food Recommendation / Flight Refund Query)](https://github.com/chenwenjun/project-intelligent-assistant) 🤖🍜✈️

- **Tech stack**: Dify Chatflow, Multi-Agent, RAG, vLLM, Qwen3  
- **Description**: Designed and implemented a multi-agent architecture to provide scalable solutions for food recommendations and flight refund queries.  
- **Key responsibilities**:
  - Designed a multi-agent system architecture with a Router classifier for intent routing.
  - Combined structured knowledge bases with RAG to provide trustworthy food recommendations and flight refund answers.
  - Used Qwen3 to ensure data safety and enable cross-agent multi-turn context sharing.

### 3. [Hanfu Rental Flash-Sale & Intelligent Customer Service Platform](https://github.com/chenwenjun/project-hanfuren) 👘⚡💬

- **Tech stack**: Spring Boot, MyBatis, Redis, RAG, Tool Calling, SSE  
- **Description**: Built a high-concurrency flash-sale system for a Hanfu rental platform and introduced intelligent customer service using an RAG knowledge base to improve user experience.  
- **Key responsibilities**:
  - Designed flash-sale activities and inventory consistency solutions to ensure “one customer, one order” and prevent overselling.
  - Implemented multi-user conversation memory isolation, supporting up to 20-turn context memory.
  - Used RAG-based knowledge storage to provide domain-specific Q&A, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.

## 📜 Research & Competitions
