# Chen Wenjun's Personal Homepage 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a developer passionate about technological innovation, focusing on backend development, large model applications, and various cutting-edge technologies. My tech interests include C/C++; Java & Spring Boot; Redis; Python, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and multi-agent systems. I'm currently exploring multi-agent paradigms and optimizations such as Plan & Solve, ReAct, and Reflexion. I have a solid computer science foundation and strong teamwork skills, and I keep a persistent curiosity for new technologies 🚀.
